# Spooky Stones and potentially other meme runs randomizer

This is NOT Yune's Universal FE randomizer. If you want to randomize your games, go here:
https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer

This repository is a fork (a copy) of the original randomizer repo. It exists so I can edit the code for stupid meme runs. I will add jar files should you wish to play along with me. Please don't expect a whole lot of support on my end for this code though: when it comes to Java I can tinker with things at best. Feel free to make pull requests though.
