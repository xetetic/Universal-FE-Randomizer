# Spooky Stones and potentially other meme runs randomizer

This is NOT Yune's Universal FE randomizer. If you want to randomize your games, go here:
https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer

This repository is a fork (a copy) of the original randomizer repo. It exists so I can edit the code for stupid meme runs. I will add jar files should you wish to play along with me. Please don't expect a whole lot of support on my end for this code though: when it comes to Java I can tinker with things at best. Feel free to make pull requests though.

# spookyyune.jar

To play Spooky Stones, download spookyyune.jar. Use it like you would the Universal FE Randomizer, but if FE8 classes are randomized, ONLY monster classes will be used to randomize characters. That means any characters you choose to randomize (player, enemy, bosses) will become monsters. It will try to prevent enemies from getting stuck in the mountains by generating mogalls, gargoyles, and baels there. However, enemy thieves remain the same. I don't know why yet.
